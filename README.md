# 📊 A/B Test Analysis with Tableau – DigitalPath Innovations  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
DigitalPath Innovations conducted an **A/B test** over two weeks to evaluate user engagement, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction across two webpage versions (Version A & B). Using **Tableau BI**, I performed an in-depth analysis, visualized key insights, and derived **data-driven recommendations** to optimize digital user experience.

- **📈 Engagement Analysis** – Assess user behaviour via time on site, pages per session, and bounce rates.  
- **💰 Conversion Rate Optimization** – Evaluate checkout funnel effectiveness for both versions.  
- **🗣️ User Feedback Analysis** – Correlate feedback submission rates with engagement levels.  
- **📑 Content Interaction Trends** – Investigate how users engage with videos & on-page content.  
- **🌍 Referral Source Impact** – Understand how traffic sources affect user preferences.
